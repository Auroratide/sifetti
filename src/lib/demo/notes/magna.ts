export const content = `Magna is a type of stone found only on the Serpentine Isles. It behaves essentially like a magnet but with some extra quirks when mechanically or electrically excited.

Magna is often at the center of many inventions.

## Properties

* Magna is a red and blue metal-like substance found embedded in the stone.
* In its base state, magna acts exactly like a magnet with two poles.
* Magna can be put into an "excited" state with enough mechanical force or electric current.
  * When excited in this way, one of the poles acts as both poles simultaneously.
  * As a result, excited magna left alone will propel itself in the direction of the magnetic field lines.
  * Unless maintained, magna loses its excited state after some time proportional to the work done to make it excited.
