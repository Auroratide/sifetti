## Appearance

* **Race**: Dwarf
* **Gender**: Cis-female
* **Age**: 45

Though the City Captain's uniform bears a number of accolades not found on city guard uniforms, they seem to be sloppily arranged. Most notable about this dwarf is a metallic fixture in place of one of her legs serving as a crude replacement of sorts.

## Personality

* Baha is notably obsessive over the capture of Captain Whitebeard and subduing the White Whale.
* She demonstrates her lack of success and sleep with the occassional brief and grumpy remark.

## Info

* **Goal**: To capture Captain Whitebeard and put him behind bars for good.
* Eight years ago, Baha was a naval captain whose ship was attacked by the White Whale. In the encounter, Baha suffered a wound so grievous it merited amputation.
* Despite her failure to make meaningful leads in the capture of Whitebeard, Baha's leadership and success capturing lesser pirates led her to becoming the city captain of the isles' largest city.
* Baha has not taken time to investigate rumors of cheating in the upcoming Skimming Contest, her full attention on Whitebeard's potential activities during a time of high tourism.
