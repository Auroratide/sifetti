export const content = `The Serpentine Skimming Contest is a quinquennial race between teams of five from all over the world.

The race involves the practice of **skimming**, essentially lightweight sailing across the clouds surrounding the isles. Teams navigate the winds tracing a predefined track to see who can finish the fastest.

Traditionally, a team from Azurin's sky navy participates along with teams from other cities on the continent.
