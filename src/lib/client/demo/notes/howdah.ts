## Appearance

* **Race**: Tiefling
* **Gender**: Bi-female

Howdah's wispy white hair and long, crooked horns make them look older than they are. Their pupils stand out against the bright yellow of their eyes, making their gaze uncomfortably piercing.

## Personality

* Accustomed to being busy, Howdah is not fond of conversations that distract them from their work. Though accomodating at the beginning, their sentences shortens as their patience runs low.
* Although known for a few military innovations, Howdah prefers to discuss their current work in archeology.
* Howdah enjoys mentoring those under them to become State Engineers.

## Info

* **Goal**: To use the Lodestone to bring back the Azure Serpents, which were thought to manipulate the weather.
* Howdah is an expert in magna science and technology. Over the years as an engineer, they have invented:
  * The Azurin Arrow, an arrow enhanced by magna to fly faster and farther than conventional arrows.
  * Steering assistance for sky ships, making certain models more maneuverable than before.
  * Compass improvements to assist in navigation, as ambient magnetic fields make traditional compasses less reliable.
* Howdah is also secretly responsible for the development of the Magun, which is essentially a pistol powered by magna rather than gunpowder. They have not disclosed this invention to the military for fear of its abuse.
* Howdah's primary responsibility as a lead archeologist is to uncover utility of the technology found in the ruins.
