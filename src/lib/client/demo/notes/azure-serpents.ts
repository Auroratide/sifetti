## The Myth

> Before there was magic, there were dragons. Beacons of power, beauty, and wisdom, the dragons of olde were worthy of worship, and worship the people did give. Most elegant among them were the Sky Serpents, like jeweled sapphire ribbons floating among the eleven winds. With them came the rain. With them came the calm. With them came the harvest. They were a symbol of prosperity to come.
> 
> But woe to those who lived in those days, the days the Sky Serpents ceased their visitation. Gone were the days of the rain, calm, and harvest, leaving the people only with drought and famine. The judgement was rendered on the land against the people, whose complacency left them to their own ruin. May this tale teach all who hear of their dependence on the beacons of power, beauty, and wisdom, the dragons of olde, so that the return of the Sky Serpents can be at hand.

## Modern Take

* Blue dragons of the sort depicted in the legends have not been observed for hundreds of years, leading many to believe they are just myth.
* Additionally, remains of said dragons have never been found among the islands.
* Scholars take the fable to be a metaphor for a dependence on vanity.
* In modern times, the story of the blue dragons is known mostly as an old bedtime story told to children encouraging them to focus on developing their intellect.
