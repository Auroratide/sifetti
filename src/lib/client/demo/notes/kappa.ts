export const content = `Kappa is an inventor whose main aspiration is to become one of Azurin's State Engineers.

## Appearance

* **Race**: Dwarf
* **Gender**: Cis-female
* **Age**: 24

Kappa has frazzled blonde hair tied into twintails, one slightly longer than the other, topped with an orange flatcap. She wears a stuffed backpack probably meant to be worn by a half-giant and not a dwarf.

## Personality

* She's not very sociable, and is rather obsessed with her projects.
* For the sake of speed, she tends to cut corners with safety, oblivious to the amount of luck she's had not injuring herself or anyone else.
* Very liberal with money as long as it accomplishes whatever her goals are at the time.
* Is a bit paranoid about people stealing her ideas, and hence tends to be secretive on what she's working on or how her inventions work.

## Info

* **Goal**: To be recognized as a State Engineer and to have one of her inventions be widely used (and named after her, of course).
* Hopelessly in debt. Kappa has taken large loans from different influential people in Azurin to fund her projects in the hopes one would succeed.
* Most of her inventions are "failures" in the sense that no one wants to buy them.
* Kappa is currently putting all her efforts into the Kappa Kopter, a magna-based device she believes will help her win the Serpentine Skimming Context.
